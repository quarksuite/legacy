*IMPORTANT: If you’ve arrived from one of the other projects, it would be a good idea to get up to speed on Quarksuite’s new objectives and design. We’re on the road to v1 now. Stay tuned.*

## Introduction

Quarksuite is a toolkit for creating subatomic design systems. It provides what you need to create and maintain beautiful, consistent designs based on solid principles. Build a universe.

## Why Quarksuite?

### Designed for Consistency

Quarksuite is intended to make it easy to create flexible design systems. The only limit for what you can do with these utilities is your imagination. And your constraints, of course.

### Works How You Work Best

Quarksuite makes absolute no assumptions about your stack or how your system will be used. It provides the building blocks to take away most of our bikeshedding habits. Never worry about what color that button was again.

You like Webpack? You can use Quarksuite. You like React? Quarksuite is for you, too. Vue’s your soulmate? Quarksuite’s got your back. Do you build UIs by sprinkling unicorn horn powder while reciting incantations? Quarksuite will attract more mythical beasts to maim.

### Single Source of Truth

I get it, it’s overused. I mean it earnestly in this case. Quarksuite augments your design workflow with single, or multiple data sets organized around **your** project. You can use a design system built with this toolkit in any interface that reads and writes data. Which is **every** interface.
