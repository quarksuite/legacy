# Contributing

First, I want to thank you for for your interest in helping the project grow. Since this is still a small, obscure library, I have no community-wide guidelines or a formal Code of Conduct. I’ll add them if they’re needed.

For now, I do have a light set of rules.

## Guideline #1: Explain Your Issue Clearly

If and when something breaks, please remember to be thorough so we can figure out the problem together. I’ll try to be as prompt as I can, but I ask that you help me help you. When submitting an issue, include if applicable:

+ The nature of your issue
+ The error message returned by the terminal
+ Your OS
+ Your Node version
+ The version of Quarksuite
+ What you’ve already tried to fix

## Guideline #2: Be Patient

I understand it’s no fun when code breaks. I understand bug panic especially when a project is out in production. But I’m not in a habit of rushing, and it’s best to take that into account.

I take a lot of breaks from the Internet—sometimes for weeks. I have personal reasons for staying off. If you happen to run into an issue during my self-care days, send me an email, and then wait.

## Guideline #3: Keep the Stated Goals in Mind

I’m thrilled that you want to submit a pull request. I appreciate that you put in the time and effort to improve and contribute to this project. I admit to having a particular vision for it that might be incompatible with a lot of feature requests and enhancements. If your contribution would veer the project away from [its goals](README.md#goals), I’m not gonna accept it. We can certainly discuss the code and its motivation, but I won’t merge it.

However, if your contribution would make the project smaller, faster, cleaner, and easier to understand while honoring its purpose: **please**  [submit a pull request](https://github.com/quarksuite/core/pulls). I’d really appreciate the help.
